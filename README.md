# Mento-Mind-Assignment
## ðŸ“š | Problem Statement
This project is a web-based drag-and-drop table application where users can dynamically add rows and swap boxes between table cells. Each cell contains a colored box with a number, and users can drag boxes from one cell to another. Additional rows can be added, and an undo feature allows reversing the most recent swap action.

### Features:
- single unified history stack and a pointer-based undo/redo mechanism using the Command Design Pattern.
- Drag-and-drop functionality: Allows users to move boxes between table cells by dragging and dropping them.
- Dynamic Row Addition: Users can add new rows to the table, each containing a set of boxes with unique numbers.
- Undo Functionality: Users can undo the last drag-and-drop operation or RowAdd operation,, reverting the table to its previous state.
- Redo Functionality: Users can redo the last drag-and-drop operation or RowAdd operation, reverting the table to its previous state.
- Smooth Animations: Dragging and swapping boxes is accompanied by smooth animation for a better user experience.
- Random Box Colors: Each box is assigned a random background color when created.
### Technologies Used:
**HTML,CSS, JavaScript**
